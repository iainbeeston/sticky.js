# sticky.js

Sticky elements, done as simply and as smoothly as possible, with no jumping when the transition occurs.

## Usage

```javascript
$('.header').sticky()
```

## Customisation

Sticky adds a couple of CSS classes to your stylesheet. You can change the appearance of stuck elements by customising `[data-stuck]` in your CSS.
